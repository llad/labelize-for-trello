Chrome extension to add text to the display of labels on cards.  Infrequent users of a board may not remember what the
label colors stand for.  The extension extends the height of the label on the card and adds the first three letters of the
name to the box.

Usage
-----
This extension will take the first 3 characters of the label name.  If the first three letters are not unique or clear,
you may want to use a naming convention that puts 3 meaningful letters at the front of the label name.  For example:
HRR-Human Resources Request.
